	Smart City refer to the city that integrates modern technologies for automated and efficient service providing to enhance citizens’ lifestyle. Latest studies show that like 60 present of the whole world's population will be living in urban environments by the year 2030. This massively growing population in urban environments leads to the need of advanced management approaches that use latest IT platforms and techniques for smartening every city-related service. Such emergent integration of technologies faces several security- related challenges because of not considering security tests of new deployed technologies, in addition to not engaging other system parties with security incidents due to the huge communication. On the other side, high complexity, high interdependency and intensive communication lead to unbounded attack surface and cryptography-related issues. In our paper, we intend to provide detailed overview based on literature of smart cities’ major security problems and current solutions. Moreover, we present several influencing factors that affect data and information security in smart cities."

	abstract = "Publisher Summary
	This chapter discusses a framework for clustering evolving data streams. The clustering problem is a difficult problem for the data stream domain. This is because the large volumes of data arriving in a stream render most traditional algorithms too inefficient. In recent years, a few one-pass clustering algorithms have been developed for the data stream problem. Although such methods address the scalability issues of the clustering problem, they are generally blind to the evolution of the data and do not address the following issues: (1) the quality of the clusters is poor when the data evolves considerably over time. (2) A data stream clustering algorithm requires much greater functionality in discovering and exploring clusters over different portions of the stream. The widely used practice of viewing data stream clustering algorithms as a class of one-pass clustering algorithms is not very useful from an application point of view. The chapter discusses a fundamentally different philosophy for data stream clustering which is guided by application-centered requirements. It divides the clustering process into an online component, which periodically stores detailed summary statistics and an offline component, which uses only this summary statistics. The problems of efficient choice, storage, and use of this statistical data for a fast data stream turns out to be quite tricky. The concepts of a pyramidal time frame in conjunction with a micro-clustering approach are used."

	abstract = "In this paper, we analyze the network attacks that can be launched against Internet of Things (IoT) gateways, identify the relevant metrics to detect them, and explain how they can be computed from packet captures. We then present the principles and design of a deep learning-based approach using dense random neural networks (RNN) for the online detection of network attacks. Empirical validation results on packet captures in which attacks are inserted show that the Dense RNN correctly detects attacks. However our experiments show that a simple threshold detector also provides results of comparable accuracy on the same data set."

	abstract = "Cybersecurity continues to be a serious issue for any sector in the cyberspace as the number of security breaches is increasing from time to time. It is known that thousands of zero-day attacks are continuously emerging because of the addition of various protocols mainly from Internet of Things (IoT). Most of these attacks are small variants of previously known cyber-attacks. This indicates that even advanced mechanisms such as traditional machine learning systems face difficulty of detecting these small mutants of attacks over time. On the other hand, the success of deep learning (DL) in various big data fields has drawn several interests in cybersecurity fields. The application of DL has been practical because of the improvement in CPU and neural network algorithms aspects. The use of DL for attack detection in the cyberspace could be a resilient mechanism to small mutations or novel attacks because of its high-level feature extraction capability. The self-taught and compression capabilities of deep learning architectures are key mechanisms for hidden pattern discovery from the training data so that attacks are discriminated from benign traffic.Â This research is aimed at adopting a new approach, deep learning, to cybersecurity to enable the detection of attacks in social internet of things. The performance of the deep model is compared against traditional machine learning approach, and distributed attack detection is evaluated against the centralized detection system.Â The experiments have shown that our distributed attack detection system is superior to centralized detection systems using deep learning model. It has also been demonstrated that the deep model is more effective in attack detection than its shallow counter parts."

	abstract = "The main aim in network anomaly detection is effectively spotting hostile events within the traffic pattern associated to network operations, by distinguishing them from normal activities. This can be only accomplished by acquiring the a-priori knowledge about any kind of hostile behavior that can potentially affect the network (that is quite impossible for practical reasons) or, more easily, by building a model that is general enough to describe the normal network behavior and detect the violations from it. Earlier detection frameworks were only able to distinguish already known phenomena within traffic data by using pre-trained models based on matching specific events on pre-classified chains of traffic patterns. Alternatively, more recent statistics-based approaches were able to detect outliers respect to a statistic idealization of normal network behavior. Clearly, while the former approach is not able to detect previously unknown phenomena (zero-day attacks) the latter one has limited effectiveness since it cannot be aware of anomalous behaviors that do not generate significant changes in traffic volumes. Machine learning allows the development of adaptive, non-parametric detection strategies that are based on âunderstandingâ the network dynamics by acquiring through a proper training phase a more precise knowledge about normal or anomalous phenomena in order to classify and handle in a more effective way any kind of behavior that can be observed on the network. Accordingly, we present a new anomaly detection strategy based on supervised machine learning, and more precisely on a batch relevance-based fuzzyfied learning algorithm, known as U-BRAIN, aiming at understanding through inductive inference the specific laws and rules governing normal or abnormal network traffic, in order to reliably model its operating dynamics. The inferred rules can be applied in real time on online network traffic. This proposal appears to be promising both in terms of identification accuracy and robustness/flexibility when coping with uncertainty in the detection/classification process, as verified through extensive evaluation experiments."
